# data
This project collects the open data resources of the [Fluoride Knowledge and Action Network](http://fluorideindia.org).

All data contributed here is made public. Do not add data here that has any privacy or security questions.

Each data set is contained in its own directory with the following structure

    [dir]data_set_name
        [dir]original_data_set
        [dir]csv
        [dir]geojson
        [dir]metadata
            contributors.md
            license.md
            colunmns.md
            file_list.md
            description.md

``metadata/contributors.md`` has a list of contributors and funders for this data set.

``metadata/license.md`` has the license this data is released under.
