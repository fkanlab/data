# Description
This is a sample data set. It contains a data set of Fluoirde in water sources as measured by [Caddisfly](http://caddisfly.ternup.com). The data was collected during a field test at Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh. At the time of data collection, the kit was under active development.

## Data collection methodology
### Testing methodology
The Caddisfly test kit uses colorimetry to maeasure the amount of Fluoride in water. This particular test is meant to be a screening test for drinking water, and is sensitive from about 0.2 ppm to 2 ppm. For higher concentrations, the tester would have to dilute the sample. Three phones were used in the process and the reagent used was Xylenol Orange.

Field samples (only a small number have been released here) were gathered around Jhabua. The samples were compared with testing at CALF lab, Anand, and Underwriter's Laboratory, Bengaluru. Samples locations chosen were ground water and surface water points used for drinking at a few locations in areas that INREM was active / had a local presence.
